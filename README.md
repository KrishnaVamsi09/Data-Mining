# Data-Mining
In this project we discuss about the approaches that are performed on the datasets. Proper problem statements are discussed.  The solutions for those proposed questions are interpreted by two approaches i) Collaborative filtering Algorithm and ii) Apriori Algorithm results.  Visualizations and tables are also introduced to enhance the results. The results are carried out by the approaches.
